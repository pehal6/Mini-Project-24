# 📏 Resize 100 Colored Images to 50% using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to resize a batch of colored images to 50% of their original dimensions using **Python** and **OpenCV**. It’s a simple yet powerful utility, especially useful for:

- Reducing image dataset size for machine learning
- Optimizing web and mobile app performance
- Batch image processing and automation
